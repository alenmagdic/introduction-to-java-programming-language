/**
 * This class extends {@link AbstractAction} class but does not implement its
 * method (actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)). It is an abstract class representing
 * a class that can be localized. So, it adds a new listener to the specified
 * {@link ILocalizationProvider} (specifid as constructor argument) that
 * refreshes the current action specifications (action name, short description
 * and mnemonic) so that they are appropriate for the current localization. In
 * order to check if there is a short description or a mnemonic for this action,
 * it is assumed that keys for short descriptions are made by concatenating the
 * key for action name and "_desc" (or "_mnm" for mnemonics). For example, if
 * there is a key for action name named "open", then a key for a description of
 * that action is expected to be equal to "open_desc".*
